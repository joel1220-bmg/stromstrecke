/*
 * Extended 18.09.2026.
 *
 * Until then the only tags here were title, description and robots, so a link
 * to stromstrecke.de pasted into LinkedIn, Slack or WhatsApp arrived as a bare
 * URL with no card. For a site whose whole purpose is to be shown to someone,
 * that is the first impression, and it was blank.
 *
 * `metadataBase` is what turns the relative image path below into the absolute
 * URL every scraper requires; without it Next drops the tag and says so only
 * as a build warning.
 *
 * The colon in the title became a middot at the same time. Every other page
 * here already reads "Impressum · Stromstrecke", and the house rule for this
 * site's copy is no colons.
 *
 * Two tags left on 22.09.2026. `openGraph.url: "/"` was inherited by every
 * page, so a shared /berater/ link declared itself to be the home page; without
 * it, scrapers use the address they fetched. And `robots: index, follow` is
 * the default anyway, but spelled out here it stood next to the "noindex" that
 * Next puts on the 404 page, two contradicting tags on one page.
