/**
 * Side-profile silhouettes, one per body style.
 *
 * The reader this serves has never owned an electric car and is scanning a list
 * of names that mean nothing to them yet. A shape they can recognise in a
 * glance, small or estate or tall, does more than another line of text.
 *
 * Proportions come from the BODY_DIMS table of the former 3D model generator
 * (removed with the unused showroom on 22.09.2026), scaled into one shared
 * viewBox. The table below is now the only copy. A crossover has to look
 * taller than a hatch and a sedan longer.
 *
 *   body        L     W     H      roof    deck
 *   hatch     4.26  1.81  1.56     0.66    hatch
 *   compact   4.40  1.84  1.60     0.68    hatch
 *   kombi     4.75  1.87  1.52     0.56    hatch (flat roof to a square tail)
 *   sedan     4.78  1.85  1.44     0.42    sedan (fastback)
 *   crossover 4.55  1.92  1.68     0.70    crossover (raised)
 *
 * Usage: <BodyIcon body={car.body} className="h-5 w-auto text-muted" />
 *
 * Filled with `currentColor`, so the caller sets the colour by CSS — the same
 * icon sits in a card, a table cell or a chip without a second variant.
 * `aria-hidden` by default: the car's name is always right next to it, so the
 * icon is decorative. Pass `title` for the rare case where it carries meaning
 * on its own.
