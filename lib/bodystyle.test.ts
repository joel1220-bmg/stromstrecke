/**
 * A body style only exists once every consumer knows it.
 *
 * `CLAUDE.md` records what happens otherwise: "compact" was added to the union
 * and to the catalogue while the generator still produced three models, and the
 * build died. "kombi" was added on 13.09.2026, so this file walks the whole
 * chain rather than trusting that it was remembered.
 *
 * The generated 3D dimensions were part of that chain until 22.09.2026, when
 * the unused 3D showroom was removed together with its models. The icons in
 * `components/showroom/BodyIcon.tsx` are drawn by hand and need no table.
